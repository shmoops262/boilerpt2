<h1>Keys</h1>

<div class="container">
  <img class="item-image" src="/images/keys.svg" alt="Keys" />
  <p class="short-desc">My car and apartment keys — small but essential.</p>
  <p>I never leave home without my keys because I can't get in my car or my place without them. They live on a ring with a small flashlight and a key fob. Losing them would ruin my day.</p>
  <p class="why">Why I can't leave without them: I need access to both transportation and shelter.</p>
</div>
