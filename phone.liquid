<h1>Phone (iPhone)</h1>

<div class="container">
  <img class="item-image" src="/images/phone.svg" alt="iPhone" />
  <p class="short-desc">My iPhone — maps, music, messaging, and everything in between.</p>
  <p>I'm terrible with directions, so my phone (and Google Maps) is essential. It also holds my contacts, passes, and payment apps — leaving it behind makes many daily tasks harder.</p>
  <p class="why">Why I can't leave without it: navigation and connectivity — I'd get lost and miss important messages.</p>
</div>
